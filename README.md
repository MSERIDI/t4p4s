# General description

The purpose of this branch (p4c2py) is to make the interface of the newest P4 ([P4_16](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c)) available from Python, and to use the resulting Python IR to translate P4 sources.

Currently, code for the first stage is available. See the README in the `src/p4c2py` directory for further details.
